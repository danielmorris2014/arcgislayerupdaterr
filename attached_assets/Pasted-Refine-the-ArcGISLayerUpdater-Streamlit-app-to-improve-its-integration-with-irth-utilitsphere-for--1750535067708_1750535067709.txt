Refine the 'ArcGISLayerUpdater' Streamlit app to improve its integration with irth utilitsphere for retrieving and managing map layer URLs, while preserving all existing functionality (authentication with ArcGIS Online, layer management, table editing, sublayer updates, sharing settings, and FeatureServer URL generation). The app should run locally using Streamlit and the ArcGIS API for Python, with these specific adjustments to the irth integration:

Improved Retrieval of irth Map Layer URLs:
Enhance the 'irth Integration' section to correctly pull map layer URLs from [https://www.irth.com/Utilisphere/Administration/ManageMapLayers/ManageMapLayers.aspx].
Implement a more robust authentication process by using requests with session handling to log in with user-provided irth credentials (username and password via st.text_input, password as type='password'). Simulate a browser login by sending a POST request to the login endpoint (inferring it from the page structure if not explicitly documented) and maintaining the session cookie.
After successful login, use requests.get to fetch the Manage Map Layers page, then parse the HTML content with a library like BeautifulSoup to extract layer URLs from a table or list (e.g., looking for <a> tags with URLs or <td> elements containing layer data). Handle cases where the structure varies by attempting multiple parsing strategies.
Display the retrieved URLs in a st.dataframe, including layer names and URLs, with a refresh button (st.button) to re-fetch the data.
Error Handling and Troubleshooting:
Add detailed error handling for authentication failures (e.g., invalid credentials), page access issues (e.g., 403 Forbidden), or parsing errors (e.g., no URLs found), using st.error with specific messages like "Failed to log in to irth" or "No layer URLs detected on page."
Include a debug mode toggle (st.checkbox) to show raw HTML or error details for troubleshooting, displayed with st.code.
Use st.spinner during the retrieval process to indicate loading.
User Guidance:
Add a note with st.write instructing users to ensure their irth credentials have administrative access to Manage Map Layers and to verify the page structure if URLs arenâ€™t found.
Include a link to [https://www.irth.com/Utilisphere/Administration/ManageMapLayers/ManageMapLayers.aspx] for manual reference.
General Improvements:
Keep the irth section organized and separate from ArcGIS Online functionality.
Ensure compatibility with existing file handling, session state, and temporary directories.
Avoid hardcoding irth-specific endpoints; infer them dynamically from the login response or user feedback.
This refinement should enable the app to reliably pull irth map layer URLs, addressing the current issue, and provide a solid foundation for further integration.
