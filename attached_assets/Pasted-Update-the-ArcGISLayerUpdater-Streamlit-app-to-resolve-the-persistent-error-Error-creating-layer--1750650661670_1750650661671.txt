Update the ArcGISLayerUpdater Streamlit app to resolve the persistent error 'Error creating layer: 'dict' object has no attribute 'to_csv'' when uploading a shapefile zip (e.g., 'MST_BURIED.zip') to create a new layer in ArcGIS Online. The current implementation includes safe_dataframe_conversion() and safe_csv_export(), but the error persists, likely because an empty .dbf file causes the shapefile data to be processed as a dictionary instead of a pandas DataFrame. The goal is to ensure the app handles all shapefile scenarios—including those with empty or missing .dbf files—while maintaining robust data conversion and error reporting.

Objectives:

Guarantee that all data passed to the layer creation step is a pandas DataFrame, even if the .dbf file is empty or missing.
Provide specific handling for empty .dbf files by creating a default DataFrame with geometry data.
Enhance debugging with detailed logging and optional raw data display in the app.
Steps to Implement:

Shapefile Extraction and Validation:
After extracting the zip file to a temporary directory, check for the presence of .shp, .shx, and .dbf files (case-insensitive). Log warnings if .dbf is missing or empty (e.g., file size = 0), and inform the user via st.warning.
Robust Shapefile Reading:
Use geopandas.read_file() to load the shapefile from the .shp file path. Wrap this in a try-except block to catch any reading errors (e.g., invalid geometry or missing files).
If the resulting GeoDataFrame (gdf) has only a geometry column and no attributes (due to an empty .dbf), add a default column (e.g., gdf['id'] = range(len(gdf))) to ensure it’s a valid DataFrame for ArcGIS Online.
Data Type Verification and Conversion:
Before any CSV export or layer creation, check the data type with isinstance(data, pd.DataFrame). If it’s a dictionary (e.g., from an unexpected GeoPandas output), convert it explicitly:
Extract geometries and create a DataFrame with at least a geometry column.
Log the conversion attempt and any issues (e.g., 'Data was a dictionary; converted to DataFrame').
If conversion fails, raise a specific error and display it via st.error.
Layer Creation Without CSV Dependency:
Instead of relying on to_csv, use the ArcGIS API’s GeoAccessor method (gdf.spatial.to_featurelayer()) to publish the GeoDataFrame directly as a feature layer. This avoids the to_csv error entirely if the data is already a DataFrame.
Ensure the coordinate system is WGS84 (EPSG:4326) by reprojecting with gdf.to_crs('EPSG:4326') if needed.
Enhanced Error Handling and Debugging:
Log every major step (e.g., 'Extracted shapefile', 'Read GeoDataFrame', 'Publishing layer') to 'update_log.txt' with timestamps.
Add a debug toggle (st.checkbox('Show debug info')) to display the raw data structure (e.g., st.write(gdf.head())) and any error details.
Clean up temporary files in a finally block, even if errors occur.
Testing:
Test with MST_BURIED.zip and a synthetic zip file containing a shapefile with an empty .dbf to confirm the app handles both cases.
