Update the ArcGISLayerUpdater Streamlit app to resolve the persistent 'Error creating layer: 'dict' object has no attribute 'to_csv' error that occurs when uploading a zip file (e.g., 'MST_BURIED.zip') containing shapefiles to create a new layer in ArcGIS Online. The app uses the ArcGIS API for Python and GeoPandas, and the error arises during the layer creation step, indicating that a dictionary is being passed instead of a pandas DataFrame to a to_csv call. Previous attempts with WKT conversion, GeoDataFrame validation, and fallback methods have not fully resolved the issue. Implement the following targeted solution:

Objectives:

Eliminate the to_csv dependency to avoid the error.
Ensure the data remains a pandas DataFrame throughout the process.
Add detailed debugging to pinpoint where the data type changes.
Steps to Implement:

Shapefile Extraction and Initial Validation:
Extract the uploaded .zip file to a temporary directory (e.g., 'temp_shapefile') using zipfile.ZipFile.
Verify the presence of .shp, .shx, and .dbf files. If any are missing, raise an error with st.error.
Load and Validate Shapefile Data:
Use geopandas.read_file() to load the .shp file into a GeoDataFrame.
Check if the result is a gpd.GeoDataFrame with isinstance(gdf, gpd.GeoDataFrame). If not, log the failure and display st.error.
If the GeoDataFrame is empty (gdf.empty), raise a ValueError with a clear message.
Convert Geometry and Create DataFrame:
Add a 'wkt_geometry' column using gdf['geometry'].apply(lambda geom: geom.wkt if geom else None) to convert geometry to WKT.
Create a pandas DataFrame by dropping the original geometry column with df = pd.DataFrame(gdf.drop(columns='geometry')).
Verify the result is a pd.DataFrame with isinstance(df, pd.DataFrame). If not, raise a TypeError.
Direct Layer Creation Without CSV:
Use gis.content.import_data(df, title=layer_title) to create the layer directly from the DataFrame, bypassing to_csv entirely.
If import_data fails (e.g., due to data format issues), log the error and attempt a fallback by exporting to a CSV temporarily and importing it with gis.content.add().
Granular Debugging:
Add logging at every step (e.g., 'Extracted zip', 'Loaded GeoDataFrame', 'Converted to DataFrame') to app_log.txt.
Include a st.checkbox("Enable Debug Mode") to display intermediate data types and samples (e.g., st.write(type(df), df.head())) in the app.
Log the exact data structure before calling import_data to catch where it might become a dictionary.
Error Handling and Cleanup:
Wrap the entire process in a try-except block to catch all exceptions, displaying them with st.error.
Clean up the temporary directory with shutil.rmtree in a finally block.
