Enhance the existing 'ArcGISLayerUpdater' Streamlit app to improve the user interface and add a data preview feature for ArcGIS Online feature layers, while preserving all current functionality (authentication, viewing, updating, creating, merging, and deleting layers, as well as displaying FeatureServer URLs). The app should continue to run locally using Streamlit and the ArcGIS API for Python. Include the following specific improvements:

User Interface Enhancements:
Use st.sidebar to create a navigation menu with options for each major section: 'View Layers', 'Update Layer', 'Create Layer', 'Merge Layers', and 'Delete Layer'. This will declutter the main interface and make navigation more intuitive.
Add st.expander sections within each feature (e.g., 'Update Layer') to organize inputs and outputs, allowing users to collapse or expand sections as needed.
Include clear headers (st.header) and subheaders (st.subheader) to label each section and guide users through the workflow.
Data Preview Feature:
Before performing operations like updating, merging, or deleting a layer, add a 'Preview Layer Data' option. This should allow users to select a layer and view a sample of its attribute table and a simple map visualization.
Use st.dataframe to display the first few rows of the layer’s attribute table (e.g., using FeatureLayer.query to fetch a limited number of features).
For map visualization, integrate a simple map using folium or st.pydeck_chart to show the layer’s spatial data. If using folium, display the map with st.components.v1.html.
Ensure the preview is accessible from the 'View Layers' section and as a step before confirming operations like updates or merges.
Improved Feedback and Guidance:
Add st.info messages to guide users through each step, especially when selecting layers or confirming actions (e.g., 'Select a layer to preview its data before proceeding.').
Use st.warning to alert users before performing irreversible actions like deleting a layer (e.g., 'This action will permanently delete the selected layer. Proceed with caution.').
Include a 'Help' section in the sidebar with st.expander, providing brief documentation or tips on using the app’s features.
Error Handling and Validation:
Before allowing an update or merge, validate that the selected layers are compatible (e.g., same geometry type or schema). Display a st.error if they are not.
Add a check to ensure that a layer is not being updated or merged with itself, preventing unnecessary operations.
Performance Considerations:
For the data preview, limit the number of features fetched (e.g., 10 rows) to avoid performance issues with large datasets.
Use caching (@st.cache_data) for operations like fetching layer lists or preview data to speed up repeated actions.
General Improvements:
Ensure the app remains organized and easy to navigate, with clear separation between different functionalities.
Maintain existing features like CSV export and temporary file cleanup.
Avoid adding unnecessary complexity; focus on making the app more intuitive and error-resistant.
This enhancement will make the app more user-friendly, reduce the risk of errors, and provide a better overall experience for managing ArcGIS Online feature layers.
