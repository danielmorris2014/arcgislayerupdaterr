Further enhance the existing 'ArcGISLayerUpdater' Streamlit app by adding the following features while preserving all previous functionality (authentication, viewing existing feature layers, updating/creating layers, managing sharing settings, generating FeatureServer URLs, editing/deleting table contents, and updating individual sublayers). The app should continue to run locally using Streamlit and the ArcGIS API for Python. Add these enhancements:

Improved Table Editing Interface:
Enhance the attribute table display with a more interactive interface, allowing row-by-row editing using st.form or a custom edit button per row (e.g., st.button('Edit') or st.button('Delete')).
Provide a confirmation dialog (e.g., st.warning with a confirm button) before deleting rows to prevent accidental data loss.
Apply edits and deletions to the feature layer using the ArcGIS API’s edit_features method, ensuring real-time updates in ArcGIS Online.
Progress and Performance Optimization:
Add a progress bar (st.progress) and status messages during table edits, sublayer updates, and large file uploads to improve user feedback.
Implement chunked processing for large shapefiles or tables (e.g., using batch operations with edit_features) to handle performance issues with large datasets.
Enhanced Validation and Feedback:
Validate coordinate systems of uploaded .shp files against the target layer or sublayer, displaying a warning (st.warning) if mismatched and offering an option to reproject using arcgis.geometry.project.
Provide a preview of changes (e.g., edited/deleted rows) before committing, using a side-by-side comparison with st.columns.
Integration with irth Ticketing System:
After updating or creating a layer, automatically generate a CSV file containing the FeatureServer URL and layer metadata (e.g., title, update date) using pandas, downloadable via st.download_button for easy import into irth.
Include an optional field in the settings to specify an irth-specific ID or tag to associate with the layer.
User Settings Persistence:
Add a settings section to save user preferences (e.g., default sharing level, irth ID) using Streamlit secrets or a local JSON file, accessible via st.session_state.
Allow users to load and save these settings with buttons (e.g., st.button('Save Settings')).
General Improvements:
Ensure the app remains organized with clear sections for authentication, layer management, table editing, and settings.
Update error handling to cover new operations, displaying detailed messages with st.error or st.warning as needed.
Maintain file handling with temporary directories and cleanup after processing.
These enhancements will improve the app’s usability, performance, and integration with irth, making it a more robust tool for managing ArcGIS Online feature layers.
